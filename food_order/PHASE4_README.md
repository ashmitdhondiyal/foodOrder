  orderId     String   @unique
  driver      User     @relation(fields: [driverId], references: [id])
  driverId    String   @unique
  status      DeliveryStatus @default(ASSIGNED)
  assignedAt  DateTime @default(now()) // NEW: When delivery was assigned
  pickedUpAt  DateTime? // NEW: When order was picked up
