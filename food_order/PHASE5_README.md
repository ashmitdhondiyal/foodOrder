  - **Decline**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
  - **3D Secure**: 4000 0025 0000 3155

## 📊 Business Logic

### 1. Payment Rules
- Only orders without existing payments can create payment intents
- Payment amount must match order total exactly
- Failed payments automatically cancel orders
- Successful payments confirm orders

### 2. Refund Rules
- Only successful payments can be refunded
- Admins can process full or partial refunds
- Refund reasons are tracked for audit purposes
- Full refunds mark payments as refunded

### 3. Status Synchronization
- Payment success → Order CONFIRMED
- Payment failure → Order CANCELLED
- Payment cancellation → Order CANCELLED
- Refund processing → Payment status updated
